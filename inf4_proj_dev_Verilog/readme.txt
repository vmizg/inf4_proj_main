INF4 Honours Project Submission by S1451552
Hardware DNA alignment accelerator architecture files

* The backup_sources folder just contains sources from previous iteration
during development. Not relevant to the final design

* inf4_proj_dev along with init_xillybus are the main project folders.
To open the Verilog project, use Vivado and source the project from inside
inf4_proj_dev folder. The init_xillybus has dependencies related to
FPGA to host communication.

* dnabin_testfiles contains some of the binary DNA sequences for
Verilog simulation testbench, used in previous iterations,
such as preloading longer sequence for simulation of processing
element array
